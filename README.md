# Design - UI fundamentals

For this project I designed a simple webpage using the fundamental principles for UI design. Below, in this file, there is a description for each of the principles.

Please check comments in the Figma file, where I point out an example of how I used a specific principle. (Click the comment bubble to see the comments appear).




## Visual Hierarchy 

Visual hierarchy is one of the fundamentals of visual design and refers to guiding the eye on the page so that it attends to different design elements in the order of their importance, and how people process information. The goal of design is to visually communicate a message to users, through words and images. Without paying attention to visual hierarchy in design, it is likely that we fail to convey the message to users - as they can feel frustrated and overwhelmed in finding information.
Visual hierarchy can be implemented through variations in scale, value, color, spacing, placement, and a variety of other signals and principles.  



## Whitespace

White space (negative space) and spacing are fundamental to good design. Whitespace refers to the space between or around elements. It effects readability and crucial to conveying information to a user. By arranging elements on your page with enough whitespace you can avoid creating cognitive overload, use it to group elements together or draw attention to them by giving them enough breathing room.



## Typography

Typography is one of the fundamentals of design and paramount to a good user experience, and has to be toughtfully considered in terms of reability, accessibility, and hierarchy. Hierarchy can be accomplished with typography by employing the use of contrast, paddings, alternating text sizes, typefaces and margins.


### Typeface and font

A Typeface is a family of related fonts. Fonts refer to font weights, widths, and styles of that typeface.The basic typefaces are serif, sans-serif, monospace and decorative. Consistency in typeface use is key to avoiding clutered and creating confusion for the user. It helps in navigating information and as the user starts to notice a pattern.


### Typographic hierarchy

Typographic hierarchy is a system for organizing type that establishes an order of importance within the data, allowing the reader to easily find what they are looking for and navigate the content. Done right, typography can help guide the reader’s eye to where a section begins and ends, and consistent structure and style of the text throughout a webpage can help the user isolate information quickly.
The simplest way is to define our typography into three different levels:

**Level 1 (Headlines)**
The headlines are the most important content on the page. It’s usually big, bold font that first grabs the users attention.

**Level 2 (Subheadings)**
Level two typography doesn’t stand out as much as level one, but it helps to visually sort the content into different sections. Level two typography is often used for subheadings, which hints to the reader what they are about to read.

 **Level 3 (Body of text)**
Think of level three as the core of your message. If users were interested in your level one and level two typography, they will likely most likely ready level three. This is where you can go into more detail about your product, service, or topic and it’s typically in a smaller font. 



## Proximity
Proximity is one of the gestalt principles, a grouping principle, that helps you to structure your designs and group content together. It is especially important for UX/UI — it refers to the fact that items that are visually closer together are perceived as part of the same group, rather than things that are spaced farther apart. It can override other visual cues of grouping or similarity, such as color or shape. 



## Alignment

Alignment is one of the backbone do any design. Alignment helps us to make conscious decisions in how we create better composition in our design. It guides us in placement, position, orientation and grouping of elements, and components on a page. It is easier to align elements or group them with guides or grids, which give a more coherent rhythm, visual hierarchy, balance content and look to a design – which can help the user navigate and grasp the most important information.



## Scale
The principle of scale refers to using relative size to signal importance and rank in a composition. Scale can also help define the visual hierarchy, bigger elements draw the viewer’s eye towards a certain area and give elements more importance than others. A general rule of thumb is to include small, medium, and large components in the design. In bodies of text, size can be used to draw attention to meaningful subjects, headlines or information. The bigger the more important, it makes it easier for a user to scan quickly and collect information.



## Color

Colors can be used similarly to size and weight to give importance to elements in your design. Furthermore using color intentionally in website design is critical; colors evoke meaning and emotion, often at a subconscious level. When used strategically, color is a powerful tool for communicating information and brand effiecently to the user. 
 
When creating a color palette it is a good principle to use three colors as a base; a main (or primary) color, secondary color, and accent color and then use the 60/30/10 rule to apply the colors in a website design. According to this rule, 60% of the color used should be the main color, 30% the secondary color, and 10% the accent color. Then it is possible to use shades and tints of the colors as well throughout the design.



## Contrast

To build visual hierarchy with contrast, let the focal points stand out by contrasting their appearance from the other elements of the design. Contrast can be achieved through for example color choice, typeface style, pattern, saturation, and value.


### Color Contrast
The principle of contrast is often applied through color. Color contrast is a big part of accessibility and readablility. Generally, we want to use colors with high contrast for example between text and its background for readability, reducing text contrast too much can make content inaccessible, so it is good practice to use a color-contrast checker to ensure content meets WGAG standards for accessiblity.
